Im learning to hack abit of Cinnamon, hopefully here it starts!

* `github-projects` - Add your public GitHub repositories to your Cinnamon desktop, giving you quick access links and stats, basic alerts.
* `/demo/force-quit/` = A simple applet to kill a specified window - tutorial: http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/?p=156
* `/demo/test-notification/` = a simple applet which should demonstrate (or find issues) using HTML in notifications

* See [TODO](https://github.com/jamesemorgan/github-explorer/blob/master/github-projects%40morgan-design.com/TODO) for more details
